          <h1>About Jaelle</h1>
          <p>Marraige is a beautiful thing.</p>
          <p>Jaelle Wedsites was created by the marraige of graphic and web designer to a wedding planner.</p>
          <p>Being married to a wedding planner, I am able to see the great detail and planning that goes into planning someone's wedding. The time and preparation needed to plan your own wedding can sometimes be overwhelming. This is one of the reasons I decided to build a wedding website design service. Because some people don't have the time to design a truely custom wedding website.</p>
          <h2>About me</h2>

          <h2>My inspiration</h2>
          <p>These are three reasons why marraige has been good for me.</p>
